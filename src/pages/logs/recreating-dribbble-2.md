Hello!

No. 2 of this series of where I recreate dribbble designs. Although I am lacking of the right logos and images, I think I recreated it pretty nicely.

### Here's the original:

<a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/19472953-Landing-page-for-fruit-bases"> ![The Homepage!](/assets/img/dribbble-2-og.png) </a>

<br>

### Here's my version: 

<a href="/playground/pl-dribbble-2"> ![The Homepage!](/assets/img/dribbble-2-pl.png) </a>

<br>

### [See it live here! üöÄ](/playground/pl-dribbble-2)

<br>

### Techs Used:

* TailwindCSS
* SwiperJS

Overall, pretty happy on how it turned out - working responsively and all. This series is pretty fun, I'll make more of this! ü§ù
