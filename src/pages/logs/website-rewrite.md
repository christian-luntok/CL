I've rewritten my website again! That's something I tend to do quite a lot, I wanted to do a quick rundown of the new site.

### **Look**

![The Homepage!](/assets/img/homepage.png)

<small class="block text-center mt-4 mb-8">New design for the homepage.</small>

![The Blog Post!](/assets/img/posts.png)

<small class="block text-center mt-4 mb-8">New design for the logs.</small>

I've kept my og red-colored accents from my past personal sites which I use from time to time to brand my designs and website.

### **Playground**

On the playground part of the website, I wanna try to adding snippets, experiments, plugins, ideas related to web development that I'll find very interesting!

### **Font**

I was tempted to use a serif font for the title and body font but I proceeded to use [Overpass](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass) a Sans-Serif Google font, for the typograhpy of the site.


### **Build**

I previously used WordPress and now I rebuilt this site using [Astro üöÄ](https://astro.build/). I considered using Nuxt but I preferred Astro's flexible templating and fast build. 

For the styling, I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a utility-first CSS framework.

It's currently hosted on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), I am considering switching to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) very soon!

### **Content Editor**

One of the biggest things I wanted to change for this new site was to move out from [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) as my blogging platform.

On this new iteration, I'll be using markdown files, which meant I had to fire up VS Code to write it up. Hoping that this leads me to continue writing up a lot of logs.

### **Overall**

Overall, I'm very satisfied and happy with the rewrite! Happy with the decision to slightly move out from WordPress. Hopefully I can continue to write logs and my plan for the playground.
