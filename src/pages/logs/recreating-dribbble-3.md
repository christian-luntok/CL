Hello!

No. 3 of this series of where I recreate dribbble designs. 

Found this pretty sick design yesterday and thought thats going to be part 3 of this series! 

Found a pretty close image on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and the closest looking font on Google Font.

### Here's the original [#](https://dribbble.com/shots/19527801-woltex)

Happy with the way this turned out. Would love to integrate the aesthetic of this design on one of my designs in the future!
