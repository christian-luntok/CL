I wanted to have an inbuilt spell checker within my VS Code when I'm writing my Markdown files. As English is not my first language, I always misspelled words on my logs.

Luckily, VS code offers an extension just for this! Have a look at [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) and [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) and it will automatically check the spelling of your markdown, plain text and comments you've added on your code.
