Hello!

I want to try honing my CSS skills more that's why I'm starting this log.

I found this pretty cool design on dribbble, [here's the design if you want to check](https://dribbble.com/shots/18314692-Identifont-redesign-concept)

I feel like I remade it 90% accurate. There are some differences on the icons used because I don't have the icons they've used. The fonts are kinda different also.

<a href="/playground/pl-dribbble-1"> <small class="block text-base text-center mt-4 mb-8">Here's how I remade it!</small></a>


Overall, it's pretty fun to do this kind of things. I had a pretty good time adding some responsive stylings to it too.
